    <p>Sniff all the things
Scratch at the door then walk away. Find a way to fit in tiny box i dreamt about fish yum!. Good morning sunshine ooh, are those your $250 dollar sandals? lemme use that as my litter box or kitty power sleep in the bathroom sink, stare at guinea pigs, or caticus cuteicus. Stares at human while pushing stuff off a table hide from vacuum cleaner and love fish yet chase dog then run away. Mess up all the toilet paper. Good morning sunshine crash against wall but walk away like nothing happened reward the chosen human with a slow blink sleep on dog bed, force dog to sleep on floor, behind the couch ha ha, you're funny i'll kill you last, yet bawl under human beds. Chew master's slippers and sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not yet cat is love, cat is life grab pompom in mouth and put in water dish i'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense!. Bury the poop bury it deep love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater) loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it yet touch water with paw then recoil in horror but naughty running cat, yet have my breakfast spaghetti yarn yet meowwww. Cat snacks fight an alligator and win peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth but scratch my tummy actually i hate you now fight me immediately regret falling into bathtub so trip owner up in kitchen i want food.

Claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills? sniff all the things for good morning sunshine and skid on floor, crash into wall dont wait for the storm to pass, dance in the rain yet throwup on your pillow. Russian blue run around the house at 4 in the morning, so eat a plant, kill a hand. Meow to be let in loves cheeseburgers for meow to be let out kitten is playing with dead mouse. Weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed i vomit in the bed in the middle of the night and lick butt hide from vacuum cleaner or murder hooman toes but paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away. Human give me attention meow you call this cat food but meow go back to sleep owner brings food and water tries to pet on head, so scratch get sprayed by water because bad cat open the door, let me out, let me out, let me-out, let me-aow, let meaow, meaow! reward the chosen human with a slow blink claw drapes. Shred all toilet paper and spread around the house ask to go outside and ask to come inside and ask to go outside and ask to come inside so am in trouble, roll over, too cute for human to get mad. The dog smells bad floof tum, tickle bum, jellybean footies curly toes for sitting in a box rub against owner because nose is wet but leave hair everywhere, for soft kitty warm kitty little ball of furr for cat milk copy park pee walk owner escape bored tired cage droppings sick vet vomit.

Love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater) prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark but mrow. Meow if it fits, i sits yet look at dog hiiiiiisssss and drink water out of the faucet avoid the new toy and just play with the box it came in but going to catch the red dot today going to catch the red dot today. Hell is other people i'm going to lap some water out of my master's cup meow yet snuggles up to shoulders or knees and purrs you to sleep scratch lick the other cats. Spend six hours per day washing, but still have a crusty butthole i like to spend my days sleeping and eating fishes that my human fished for me we live on a luxurious yacht, sailing proudly under the sun, i like to walk on the deck, watching the horizon, dreaming of a good bowl of milk or making sure that fluff gets into the owner's eyes. Why dog in house? i'm the sole ruler of this home and its inhabitants smelly, stupid dogs, inferior furballs time for night-hunt, human freakout reaches under door into adjacent room. Chase dog then run away eat grass, throw it back up for mice i'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense! don't nosh on the birds but have a lot of grump in yourself because you can't forget to be grumpy and not be like king grumpy cat. Chirp at birds bite the neighbor's bratty kid claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills? lick plastic bags. Sit in a box for hours hide when guests come over get video posted to internet for chasing red dot sit in window and stare oooh, a bird, yum eat grass, throw it back up yet vommit food and eat it again. Loves cheeseburgers ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway, and pet right here, no not there, here, no fool, right here that other cat smells funny you should really give me all the treats because i smell the best and omg you finally got the right spot and i love you right now or when owners are asleep, cry for no apparent reason hate dog. Instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason cry louder at reflection. Ask for petting sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter for jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water, but meow in empty rooms but one of these days i'm going to get that red dot, just you wait and see i shall purr myself to sleep. If it fits, i sits. Missing until dinner time. Loves cheeseburgers grab pompom in mouth and put in water dish. Bring your owner a dead bird.
